Weather Station is a project that measures temperature and humidity both indoors and outdoors. The project is based on an article published by user r.blaszczak on majsterkowo.pl, with modifications made according to personal ideas.

Project Assumptions
Measurement of temperature and humidity indoors and outdoors
Saving measurements on a local server
Displaying the latest measurement and history in the form of a chart on a website
Building an application for the Android system
Displaying the latest measurement as a widget for Windows 10
The station is powered from the electrical grid, unlike the one described in the article. Wires from a network cable (so-called "twisted pair") of approximately 2 meters in length are used to connect the sensors to the ESP8266.

Components Used
Raspberry Pi 4 (with 4 GiB RAM)
ESP8266
DTH11 temperature and humidity sensor
DTH22 temperature and humidity sensor
Target Website View
